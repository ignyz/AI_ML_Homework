This is a project/tool made to extract IoCs from various text sources, identifying IP addresses, domain names, URLs, file hashes, and email addresses, and outputting the IoC type - score.
## Full Task:
Create a tool that can extract Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from various text sources, such as emails, security reports, and threat intelligence feeds. The extracted IoCs should include IP addresses, domain names, URLs, file hashes, and email addresses. Output at least should have IoC, type of IoC and confidentiality score.
End result depends on your knowledge and varies from a blueprint to a full-stack application with input and output windows. It could be a presentation, pdf, application, etc. We understand that it is a short time period to build something robust. We are focusing on the quality of documentation and presentation (live demo).
