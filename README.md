# AI_ML_Homework - IoCs Extraction Tool

This tool is designed to extract IoCs from various text sources, identifying IP addresses, domain names, URLs, file hashes, and email addresses, and outputting the IoC type - score.

## Features

- Extraction of IoCs from diverse text sources.
- Identification of IoC types: IP addresses, domain names, URLs, file hashes, and email addresses.
- Output generation with IoC, type, and confidentiality score.
- Optional user interface with input and output windows.
- Quality documentation and presentation materials.

## Full Task:
Create a tool that can extract Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from various text sources, such as emails, security reports, and threat intelligence feeds. The extracted IoCs should include IP addresses, domain names, URLs, file hashes, and email addresses. Output at least should have IoC, type of IoC and confidentiality score.
End result depends on your knowledge and varies from a blueprint to a full-stack application with input and output windows. It could be a presentation, pdf, application, etc. We understand that it is a short time period to build something robust. We are focusing on the quality of documentation and presentation (live demo).
